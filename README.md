# DPX

Please use this repo to report things you're working on for the Design and People Experiences team.

In order to request design input or support on something you're working on, you can either:

1. Create an issue in your own repo and apply the relevant label (`zenhub-hubs` for Hubs, `zenhub-vpn` for VPN, `zenhub-prod-integrity` for product integrity)
1. Create an issue in this repo using one of the [issue templates](https://github.com/mozilla/dpx-design-process/issues/new/choose)

If you create an issue in your own repo, make sure that it's a repo that the DPX team has at minimum read access to, so that they can be assigned to those issues for easier tracking. When in doubt, ping [@phirework](https://github.com/phirework) or [@malqinneh](https://github.com/malqinneh).

Issues from these sources will be linked to the DPX team's Zenhub workflow boards, where you can also see what else they're working on:
